# Chickencode
Discuss the problem of [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all) if you are boring

## Rules
### How to commit
1. Create folder according the problem number under problems folder if it doesn't exists.
2. Copy your solution from leetcode under the above folder even if it's failed
   - ex. `/problems/${# of problem}/${name}.js`
3. Create pull requests for your solution

### How to create pull request
1. Try to write all of the thoughts you ever have even if it's brute force or not work
2. Try to explain why it works as much as possible
3. Try to explain your time complexity as much as possible
4. If you cannot solve the problems, you can describe what's the problem you encounter
   - ex. no ideas, timeout or etc
5. all of above are nice to have, so it's okay to make the description of PR be empty :)
